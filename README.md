# WaveGuard Defense

This repository currently contains the differentiable and defense implementation of the LPC transform. We will be releasing the code for our defense and adaptive attacks with the final version of the paper. The notebook reconstructs audio using the original and differentiable implementations of the LPC transform and verifies whether the output of the two implementations matches.
